This Online Job Search System using PHP MySQL aims to help job seekers what jobs are available to apply. This system allows candidates to complete online job applications and upload their updated resume. In this way, it will be easier for employers to manage job applications, especially when there are many job candidates. Then, the employer/ admin will notify the candidate if he/she is qualified for the job.
